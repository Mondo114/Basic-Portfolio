        <p class="aboutMeParagraph">
            I was born in Newport Beach, CA. I grew up in Irvine. My favorite things to do are snorkeling, goin to the beach in general,
            eating sushi and ramen, and playing video games. I went to college at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo and studied Food
            Science. I've done research and development in flavor chemistry and product development in snack foods. I am
            now studying Web Development at the UCLA extension program with the intention of finding a job in this field
            and the possibility of developing my own websites and apps.
